## Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

## Community Guidelines

This project follows [Google's Open Source Community
Guidelines](https://opensource.google.com/conduct/).

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9-3.12 (Python 3.9+ required for Swift embedded compatibility)
- Swift toolchain 5.7+ with LLDB Python 3 bindings
- Git

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter.git
   cd swift-jupyter
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
   # or
   venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Register the kernel for development:
   ```bash
   python register.py --sys-prefix --swift-toolchain <path-to-swift-toolchain>
   ```

### Running Tests

The project includes comprehensive test suites. See [TEST_README.md](TEST_README.md) for detailed testing instructions.

Quick test commands:
```bash
# Run fast tests (kernel + simple notebook tests)
python test/fast_test.py

# Run all tests
python test/all_test.py

# Run specific test
python test/fast_test.py SimpleNotebookTests.test_simple_successful

# With verbose output
python test/fast_test.py -v
```

### Code Style

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
  - Consider using `black` for automatic formatting
  - Consider using `ruff` for linting

- **Swift**: Follow Swift API Design Guidelines
  - Use `swift-format` if available

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting a PR:

1. Run the test suite and ensure all tests pass
2. Test the kernel manually:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook  # or jupyter lab
   # Create a new Swift notebook and test your changes
   ```
3. Verify the kernel can:
   - Start successfully
   - Execute simple Swift code
   - Handle errors gracefully
   - Be interrupted and shut down cleanly

### Documentation

When adding features or making changes:
- Update README.md if user-facing changes
- Update TEST_README.md if test-related changes
- Add docstrings to Python code
- Add comments to complex Swift code
- Update compatibility matrix if dependencies change

### Submitting Changes

1. Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
   ```

3. Push to your fork and create a Pull Request

4. Ensure CI tests pass (if configured)

### Getting Help

- Check existing issues and pull requests
- Review [TEST_README.md](TEST_README.md) for testing guidance
- Read the modernization plan in `modernization-plan.json` (if available)
